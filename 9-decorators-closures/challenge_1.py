1. Implement a decorator that can pause/resume training on SIGTERM
2. Create a closure-based caching system for expensive computations
3. Build a decorator that automatically scales batch size based on GPU memory
4. Design a training scheduler that adapts based on cluster resource availability
5. Implement distributed parameter server using closures for state management

Explain the memory implications of each approach.
"""

# SYSTEM DESIGN:
"""
Design a training system that:
1. Supports preemptible instances (can be interrupted anytime)
2. Automatically migrates training across different hardware
3. Provides real-time training metrics to researchers
4. Handles heterogeneous clusters (different GPU types)
5. Supports multi-tenant resource sharing

How would decorators and closures fit into this architecture?
