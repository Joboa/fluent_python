# SYSTEM DESIGN:
"""
Design a memory-efficient training system that:
1. Handles models that don't fit in GPU memory (model parallelism)
2. Processes datasets larger than system memory  
3. Supports gradient accumulation across multiple steps
4. Maintains training metrics without memory growth
5. Handles distributed training with minimal memory overhead

What memory management strategies would you use?
