# SYSTEM DESIGN QUESTION:
"""
Design a data pipeline that:
1. Reads from multiple data sources (files, databases, APIs)
2. Applies transformations lazily 
3. Handles failures gracefully
4. Scales to multiple workers
5. Maintains deterministic ordering when needed

What data structures and algorithms would you use?
