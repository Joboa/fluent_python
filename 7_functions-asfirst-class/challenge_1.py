"""
1. How do higher-order functions improve code reusability?

3. How would you handle backward compatibility when loss APIs change?
4. Design a loss function that adapts based on model performance.
5. How do you test composed loss functions effectively?

# SYSTEM DESIGN CHALLENGE:
"""
You're building a research platform where:
1. Scientists can define custom losses in Python
2. Losses need to work with distributed training  
3. System must support A/B testing different losses
4. Loss computation should be GPU-accelerated
5. Need automatic hyperparameter tuning for loss weights

How would you architect this system?
